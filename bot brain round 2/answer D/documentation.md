Project Documentation: Parcel Delivery Robot

 Objectives:

Build a robot for  delivery:
Navigate sidewalks autonomously
Avoid obstacles like people and cars
Safely deliver parcels to given locations

Components:
1.things require-
    aluminum alloy
   Capacity: Up to 10 kg parcels

2. Microcontroller:
   Arduino Mega 2560
   Controls robot functions, sensors, and communication

3. Sensors:
   Ultrasonic Sensors (4 units): Detect obstacles up to 4 meters
   Infrared Sensors (2 units): Sense nearby objects

4. Motor Drivers:
  Controls movement speed and direction

5. Power System:
   Provides 2 hours of operation

6. Communication
    Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Modules: Enable remote control and data exchange

Circuits:
1. system Architecture:
   - Illustrates connections between microcontroller, sensors, motors, and power system

2. Motor Control:
   - Details connections for precise movement control

3. Sensor Integration:
   - Shows sensor connections for obstacle detection

In optional we can also add gps so that we can also control and check the robot whereabout and people should know in how much time there things are reaching towards them.

WORKING OF THE CODE-

code makes a robot that uses a sensor to see how far away things are.how it works:

1. Setup: It prepares the robot to use the sensor and control its motors.

2. Loop: It keeps doing these steps over and over:
    Sends a signal out with the sensor.
   Listens for the signal to come back to measure how far things are.
    If something is closer than 20 centimeters, it stops the robot and turns it to the right.
   If nothing is close, it makes the robot move forward.

3. Functions: There are commands that tell the motors what to do:
  stopRobot(): Stops the robot from moving.
  turnRight(): Makes the robot turn to the right.
  moveForward(): Makes the robot move straight ahead.

4. Serial Output: It sends messages to a computer to show how far things are from the robot.

Conclusion:
This documentation provides a concise overview of building an autonomous parcel delivery robot, detailing its components, circuits, and objectives. It guides the construction, programming, and testing phases to ensure effective and safe operation in urban environments.
This code helps the robot avoid running into things by using its sensor to see and make decisions about where to go.
