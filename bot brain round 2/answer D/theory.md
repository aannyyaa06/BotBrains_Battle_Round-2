THEORY-

Robotics is about creating machines called robots that can do things on their own. For delivering parcels, robots like drones and small vehicles are programmed to find their way to a destination and drop off packages without needing a person to do it.

Components and Sensors:

Microcontroller: Serves as the brain of the robot, directing its movements and choices.
Sensors: Use technologies like infrared and ultrasonic to detect objects in the surrounding area.
Motors: Move the robot so that it can move and carry out operations.

CONTROL-
Robots use sophisticated algorithms to determine the optimal path while deciding where to go. Using infrared or ultrasonic sensors, they detect impediments and steer clear of them. Without human assistance, these algorithms enable safe and effective robot movement.

Turning and Moving:
Robots turn smoothly using gyroscopes to stay balanced and motors to change direction and speed.

Power and Electronics:
Robots get power from batteries or plugs. All parts are connected with wires and circuits. Motor drivers control how fast or slow the robot moves by managing the motors.

Hardware and Software Cooperating:
The robot's programs make decisions based on data from sensors. For example, the program instructs the robot to stop or change direction if a sensor detects something ahead of it. This facilitates its movement without colliding with objects.

Practical Applications and Gains:
In cities, robots come in handy for safe and quick deliveries. They are faster at avoiding traffic and throngs of people than humans. Deliveries are more dependable because they can operate all day and in a variety of weather conditions. They also save money and effort, making them a wise option for delivery in urban areas.
