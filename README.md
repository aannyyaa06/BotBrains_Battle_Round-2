# BotBrains_Battle_Round-2
To program an  parcel delivery robot, we follow a simple process:

1. Component Selection /br
Microcontroller: We use Arduino Mega 2560 to control all sensors and motors.
Sensors:  ultrasonic and Sharp infrared sensors detect obstacles.
A GPS module helps the robot know its location.
Motors: DC motors move the robot, and servo motors help it turn.
 power supply & communication: remote control and monitoring.

2.Circuit Design
Connect sensors and motors to the Arduino. Sensors measure distances and detect obstacles. Motors get signals to move the robot.
The battery powers the Arduino and motors. The Wi-Fi module connects to a server for updates.

3.Programming
Initialization: Set up sensors and motors in the code.
Navigation: Use a GPS to find the route to the destination.
 Obstacle Avoidance: Use sensors to avoid obstacles.
Motor Control: Control motor speed and direction to move and turn smoothly.
Data Handling: Send data through Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.

4.testing
Test each part, then test the whole robot to ensure it works. Make sure it can navigate and avoid obstacles.

This process ensures the robot can deliver parcels autonomously in urban environments.
