# BotBrains_Battle_Round-2
To program an  parcel delivery robot, we follow a simple process:<br><br>

1. Component Selection <br>
Microcontroller: We use Arduino Mega 2560 to control all sensors and motors.<br>
Sensors:  ultrasonic and Sharp infrared sensors detect obstacles.<br>
A GPS module helps the robot know its location.<br>
Motors: DC motors move the robot, and servo motors help it turn.<br>
power supply & communication: remote control and monitoring.<br><br>

2.Circuit Design<br>
Connect sensors and motors to the Arduino. Sensors measure distances and detect obstacles. Motors get signals to move the robot.<br>
The battery powers the Arduino and motors. The Wi-Fi module connects to a server for updates.<br>

3.Programming<br>
Initialization: Set up sensors and motors in the code.<br>
Navigation: Use a GPS to find the route to the destination.<br>
 Obstacle Avoidance: Use sensors to avoid obstacles.<br>
Motor Control: Control motor speed and direction to move and turn smoothly.<br>
Data Handling: Send data through Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.<br>

4.testing<br>
Test each part, then test the whole robot to ensure it works. Make sure it can navigate and avoid obstacles.<br><br>

This process ensures the robot can deliver parcels autonomously in urban environments.
